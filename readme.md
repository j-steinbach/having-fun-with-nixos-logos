# Having fun with NixOS logos

![Inside NixOS](/out/inside-nixos-3.png)

Some basic amateur designs using the NixOS logo. Pretty similar to [high-quality-nix-stuff][4].

Made with Inkscape. That is also why the svg-previews suck. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. The next time I use [Adobe XD][5] or [Figma][6].

Heavily abuses the [Google Fonts collection][1]. 

Use however you want: ([CC BY 4.0][2])

Note: I make use of the base [NixOS logo][3] design by Tim Cuthbertson (@timbertson).
