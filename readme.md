# Having fun with NixOS logos

Some basic amateur designs using the NixOS logo. Pretty similar to [high-quality-nix-stuff][4].

Made with Inkscape[^][Honestly, [Adobe XD][5] or [Figma][6] would have been a better fit. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`]. 
Heavily abuses the [Google Fonts collection][1]. 
Use however you want: ([CC BY 4.0][2])

Note: I make use of the base [NixOS logo][3] design by Tim Cuthbertson (@timbertson).
