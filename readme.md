# Having fun with NixOS logos

![Inside NixOS](/out/inside-nixos-3.png)

Some *basic amateur designs* using the NixOS logo. Pretty similar to [nixos-artwork][7] and [high-quality-nix-stuff][4].

Created with [Inkscape][8]. That is also why the svg-previews suck. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. 

It is a pretty nifty tool, but it doesn't fully convince me -- the next time I am going to something like [Adobe XD][5] or [Figma][6].

Heavily abuses the [Google Fonts collection][1]. 

Use (almost) however you want: ([CC BY 4.0][2]).

Makes use of the base [NixOS logo][3] design by Tim Cuthbertson (@timbertson).
